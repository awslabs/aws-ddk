        Create and configure Glue job.

        This construct allows to configure parameters of the job using ddk.json configuration file
        depending on the `environment_id` in which the job is used. Supported parameters are:
        `default_arguments`,`enable_profiling_metrics`, `max_concurrent_runs`, `max_retries`,
        `timeout`, `worker_count`.

        The parameters are respected in the following order:
        1 - Explicit arguments are always preferred
        2 - Values from configuration file
        3 - Defaults are used otherwise

        Parameters

        scope : Construct
            Scope within which this construct is defined
        id : str
            Identifier of the Glue job
        environment_id : str
            Identifier of the environment
        executable : JobExecutable
            The job executable properties

        description : Optional[str]
            The description of the Glue job
        role : Optional[IRole]
            The execution role of the Glue job
        security_configuration : Optional[ISecurityConfiguration]
            The security configuration of the Glue job. If None, a default configuration is used
        timeout : Optional[Duration]
            The job execution time (in seconds) after which Glue terminates the job.
            `aws_cdk.Duration.seconds(3600)` by default.
        worker_count : Optional[int]
            The number of workers of a defined WorkerType that are allocated when a job runs
        worker_type : Optional[WorkerType]
            The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs
        job_props : Any
            Additional job properties. For complete list of properties refer to CDK Documentation -
